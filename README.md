# Billing SME Simulator 2019 I

The ultimate billing simulator. Can you bill all the customers before midnight, or will this be an invoice apocolypse? Only you can decide.

To start the game launch billingsme.py with python3, probably.

## Features
- A convenient way to waste your evening.
- Make friends and family confused as to how you spend your time.
- Slightly less frustrating than being an actual billing SME. At least you get to go to bed when you want to.
- Learn useless commands that only work in the game.
- Zero issues with hitreg.
  
## User Feedback

- A boring slog.
- My wife made fun of me for playing billing simulator instead of coming to bed.
- This game broke my keyboard.
